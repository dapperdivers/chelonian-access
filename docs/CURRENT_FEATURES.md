## Recommendations

### Immediate (No Hardware Needed)
1. Implement LED feedback using built-in LEDs
2. Add EEPROM storage for UIDs
3. Enable sleep mode for battery operation
4. Use more relay channels

### Short Term (Minimal Hardware)
1. Add emergency button on available pin
2. Implement master card programming
3. Add basic logging to EEPROM
4. Battery voltage monitoring

### Long Term (Additional Hardware)
1. RTC for time-based access
2. SD card module for extensive logging
3. Display for status information
4. Wireless connectivity

The current implementation is solid and improved over the original, but only scratches the surface of what's possible with the existing hardware. The modular architecture makes adding these features straightforward.

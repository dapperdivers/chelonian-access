# Feature Comparison: Manufacturer Code vs Current Implementation

This document compares the manufacturer's latest code (`simplestsexy.ino`) with our current implementation to identify any missing features.

## Hardware Platform Comparison

| Component | Manufacturer Code | Our Implementation | Status |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Microcontroller | ESP32-C3 | Pro Micro (ATmega32U4) | ❌ Different |
| Audio Module | JQ6500 | DFPlayer Mini | ❌ Different |
| RFID Reader | PN532 (SPI) | PN532 (SPI) | ✅ Same |
| Relays | 4x Active LOW | 4x Active LOW | ✅ Same |
| Serial Config | HardwareSerial1 (pins 20,21) | SoftwareSerial (pins 7,8) | ❌ Different |

## Feature Comparison

### Core RFID Features
| Feature | Manufacturer | Our Implementation | Status |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| 4-byte UID support | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete |
| 7-byte UID support | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete |
| UID validation | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete |
| Serial output of UIDs | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete |
| PN532 firmware display | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete |
| Passive activation retries | 0x11 | Default | ⚠️ Minor difference |

### Audio Feedback
| Feature | Manufacturer | Our Implementation | Status |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Power-up sound (track 1) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete |
| 10s timeout sound (track 2) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete |
| Access granted (track 3) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete |
| Access denied 1 (track 4) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete |
| Access denied 2 (track 5) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete |
| Access denied 3 (track 6) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete |
| Volume setting | 20/30 | 10/30 | ⚠️ Different value |
| MP3 reset on startup | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ Missing |

### Security Features
| Feature | Manufacturer | Our Implementation | Status |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Brute-force protection | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete |
| Progressive delays | ✅ 1-68 seconds | ✅ 1-68 seconds | ✅ Complete |
| Max invalid attempts | 13 | 13 | ✅ Complete |
| Reset on valid access | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete |

### Relay Control
| Feature | Manufacturer | Our Implementation | Status |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Number of relays | 4 | 4 available, 1 used | ⚠️ Partial |
| Relay activation pattern | Sequential all 4 | Only relay 1 | ❌ Different |
| Relay timing | 1s each relay | 10s total | ❌ Different |
| Relay sequence | 1→2→3→4 | Only 1 | ❌ Different |
| Active LOW logic | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Complete |

## Detailed Differences

### 1. Relay Activation Pattern
**Manufacturer's Code:**
```cpp
digitalWrite(RELAY1, LOW);
delay(1000);
digitalWrite(RELAY1, HIGH);
delay(1000);
digitalWrite(RELAY2, LOW);
delay(1000);
digitalWrite(RELAY2, HIGH);
// ... continues for all 4 relays
```
Total time: 8 seconds (4 relays × 2 seconds each)

**Our Implementation:**
```cpp
relays.setRelay(DOOR_UNLOCK_RELAY, true);
// Stays active for 10 seconds
// Only activates relay 1
```

### 2. Audio Module Initialization
**Manufacturer's Code:**
```cpp
mp3.reset();
delay(500);
mp3.setVolume(20);
```

**Our Implementation:**
```cpp
audio.setVolume(10);
// No reset command
```

### 3. Pin Assignments
The manufacturer's code uses pins 20,21 for Serial1, which don't exist on ESP32-C3 SuperMini. This needs correction as noted in our migration guide.

## Recommendations for Feature Parity

To achieve complete feature parity with the manufacturer's code:

1. **Relay Pattern Update** (Priority: High)
   - Implement sequential relay activation
   - Change timing to 1 second per relay
   - Activate all 4 relays in sequence

2. **Audio Adjustments** (Priority: Medium)
   - Add MP3 reset on startup
   - Consider increasing volume to 20/30
   - Ensure JQ6500 library compatibility

3. **Minor Adjustments** (Priority: Low)
   - Set passive activation retries to 0x11
   - Verify all timing matches exactly

## Conclusion

Our implementation covers all core security and access control features. The main differences are:
- Hardware platform (Pro Micro vs ESP32-C3)
- Relay activation pattern (single 10s vs sequential 1s)
- Audio volume and initialization
- Minor timing/configuration differences

The documentation has been updated for ESP32-C3, but the actual code implementation still targets the Pro Micro platform.

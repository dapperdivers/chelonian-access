5. **Cloud Bridge** - Internet-based control

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Bluetooth LE Setup
- [ ] Hardware integration:
  ```cpp
  class BLEController {
  private:
      BLEServer* server;
      BLECharacteristic* authChar;
      BLECharacteristic* statusChar;
      BLECharacteristic* commandChar;
      std::string devicePin;
  public:
      void begin(const char* deviceName);
      bool authenticateDevice(std::string token);
      void broadcastStatus(uint8_t status);
      std::string waitForCommand();
  };
  ```
- [ ] HM-10 or ESP32 BLE module
- [ ] Secure pairing protocol
- [ ] Range optimization (10-30m)

### Phase 2: Mobile Authentication
- [ ] **Virtual Card System**:
  ```cpp
  struct VirtualCard {
      uint8_t phoneId[16];    // Unique phone identifier
      uint8_t accessLevel;
      uint32_t validFrom;
      uint32_t validUntil;
      bool requiresNetwork;
      uint8_t encryptionKey[32];
  };
  ```
- [ ] Phone-based credentials:
  - [ ] Device UUID
  - [ ] Secure token exchange
  - [ ] Time-based codes
  - [ ] Biometric confirmation

### Phase 3: App Communication Protocol
- [ ] **BLE Services**:
  ```cpp
  // Service UUIDs
  #define SERVICE_UUID        "12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef0"
  #define AUTH_CHAR_UUID      "12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef1"
  #define STATUS_CHAR_UUID    "12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef2"
  #define COMMAND_CHAR_UUID   "12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef3"
  ```
- [ ] Message format:
  - [ ] JSON for commands
  - [ ] Binary for efficiency
  - [ ] Encryption layer
  - [ ] Message authentication

### Phase 4: Mobile App Features
- [ ] **Core Functionality**:
  - [ ] Auto-connect when in range
  - [ ] Background operation
  - [ ] Unlock button
  - [ ] Access history
  - [ ] Settings management
  
- [ ] **Advanced Features**:
  - [ ] Geofencing auto-unlock
  - [ ] Share temporary access
  - [ ] Push notifications
  - [ ] Multiple door support
  - [ ] Offline mode

### Phase 5: Security Implementation
- [ ] **Authentication Flow**:
  ```cpp
  bool authenticateMobile(BLEClient* client) {
      // 1. Exchange public keys
      // 2. Client sends signed challenge
      // 3. Verify signature
      // 4. Create session key
      // 5. All further comm encrypted
      
      return verifySignature(challenge, signature, publicKey);
  }
  ```
- [ ] Rolling codes
- [ ] Certificate pinning
- [ ] Man-in-the-middle protection
- [ ] Replay attack prevention

### Phase 6: Guest Access
- [ ] **Temporary Access Sharing**:
  ```cpp
  struct GuestAccess {
      std::string guestPhone;
      uint32_t startTime;
      uint32_t endTime;
      uint8_t maxUses;
      uint8_t usedCount;
      bool requiresApproval;
      std::string sharedBy;
  };
  ```
- [ ] QR code generation
- [ ] Time-limited links
- [ ] One-time passwords
- [ ] Access approval workflow

### Phase 7: App User Interface

  ```
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │   ACCESS CONTROL    │
  ├─────────────────────┤
  │                     │
  │    [UNLOCK DOOR]    │
  │                     │
  │  Status: Locked 🔒  │
  │  Last: 2:30 PM     │
